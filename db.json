In 1997 he becomes editor of the renowned Serbian magazine “Svet Kompjutera” and in 2001 he started his first TV show called Game Over. After that, it was time to become a bit serious so in 2019 KursorTV was born, a TV show that was covering mostly tech topics. In 2014 Aleksandar decided to make a switch in his career and dedicate his time to YouTube. During the last 5 years, he was focused on helping brands utilize this platform to a full extent. Kojot considers YouTube channel of “Sport Klub” the prime example of YouTube SEO power. Thanks to the great content and good optimization Sport Klub channel reached[masked] subscribers in under 18 months.",

The 27th edition of Tinel is scheduled for the 22nd of August, featuring an interesting talk by Code4hire's founder Srdjan Vranac who will address the technical side of data storage.
